Kiwoon Learning is a multiplatform financial literacy service first conceptualized by David Mun and Caleb Kim.

It aims to provide educational content free of charge, and currently fields over 40 videos on YouTube with a commendable 7,000 views.

The [website](https://kiwoonlearning.com) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHx6JgXbYxNvKQ_qzY5whw) are available as follows.

Currently, I am jointly responsible for the website design along with Tymur Arsentiev. I plan to completely revamp the front-end over winter break.

There are plans to start building a Unity-based day trading battle royale game by second semester. I'll keep posted on what that exactly looks like.
